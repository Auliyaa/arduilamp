Original design credits to [Agent_Cain](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2974862).

I used the original design without modification, using the Top_Hard variant and without printing any of the Plane.stl files.

Then I hot glued the top section over the base after puting a square of 2x2 LEDs inside it.

The code was modified accordingly to set LED group size to 4 (see board.h).

Printed on a Creality Ender 3 with SmartFil white PLA.
